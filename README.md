# OpenRAW

An open standard for storing RAW data 

## Welcome

Welcome to the OpenRAW community! We are a group of developers, designers, and users dedicated to creating and maintaining a robust, open standard for RAW data storage. This forum is where we discuss the standard, propose improvements, and help each other solve problems.

## What is OpenRAW?

OpenRAW is a robust, human-readable RAW format optimized for fast machine reading and small size, with an emphasis on security and compatibility.

## Introduction

The state of digital capture and delivery, be it images, video, or audio, and its future evolution will be driven by a strong foundation that defines standards for digital storage formats. Current standards are haphazard, burdensome, and sometimes so convoluted that errors result when stored data is accessed. 

## Why OpenRAW?

An industry standard is best judged by its elegance as a coding tool, and we believe the standard proposed here meets those requirements. Another criterion is profiled input, efficient compression, and transfer of data, where existing standards fare poorly. Colourspace as currently captured in existing image formats is limited in definition and capabilities, which has led to common colour profile misunderstandings and misuse. As those limitations are overcome, the lost colour information in existing archived image data can never be recovered. The need for an improved, seamlessly upgradeable open standard for digital storage formatting is at a critical point. This standard paves the way to a clean, future-proof, and robust digital storage format from capture to delivery.
