    <h1>OpenRAW: An Open Standard for Storing RAW Data</h1>
    <p>Defining a robust human readable RAW format optimized for fast machine reading and small size with an emphasis on security and compatibility.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The state of digital capture, be it images, video or audio and its future evolution will be driven by a strong foundation that defines standards for digital storage formats. Current standards are haphazard, burdensome, and sometimes so convoluted that errors result when stored data is accessed.</p>

    <h3>Why OpenRAW?</h3>
    <p>An industry standard is best judged by its elegance as a coding tool, and we believe the standard proposed here meets those requirements. Another criterion is lossless capture, efficient compression and transfer of data, where existing standards fare poorly. And finally, colourspace as currently captured in existing image formats is limited in definition and capabilities which has led to common colour profile misunderstandings and misuse. As those limitations are overcome, the lost colour information in existing archived image data can never be recovered. The need for an improved seamlessly upgradeable open standard for digital storage formatting is at a critical point. This standard paves the way to a clean future-proof and robust digital storage format.</p>
